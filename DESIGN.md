# StradaScope Landing Page Design Brief

This document outlines the design and content strategy for the StradaScope landing page. The primary goal of this page is to generate qualified leads from potential municipal customers by clearly communicating the value of our road monitoring platform and compelling them to request a demonstration.

## 1. Overall Style & Palette

*   **Style:** Modern, professional, clean, and data-driven. The design should feel trustworthy and technologically advanced, avoiding overly flashy or whimsical elements. It should inspire confidence in the data and the platform.
*   **Fonts:**
    *   **Headings:** A clean, strong sans-serif font like **Inter** or **Montserrat**. It should be bold and impactful.
    *   **Body:** A highly readable sans-serif font like **Inter** or **Lato**.
*   **Color Palette:**
    *   **Primary:** Deep Blue (`#0A2540`) - Evokes trust, stability, and professionalism.
    *   **Secondary:** Shades of Gray (e.g., `#F6F9FC` for backgrounds, `#525F7F` for text) - For a clean, modern look.
    *   **Accent (for CTAs):** A vibrant, contrasting color like a bright blue (`#007BFF`) or a tech-oriented green (`#28A745`) to draw attention to buttons and key links.
    *   **Data Visualization:** Use a clear color scheme for charts and maps, e.g., Green (Good), Yellow (Warning), Red (Critical) to represent road conditions.

## 2. Imagery & Visuals

The visuals should reinforce the concepts of technology, data, and infrastructure.

*   **Hero Image:** A compelling composite image or short background video. This could show an animated data layer over a high-quality aerial shot of a city road network.
*   **Icons:** Use clean, line-art icons to represent benefits (e.g., a piggy bank with a down arrow for "Cost Reduction," a crystal ball for "Predictive Analytics").
*   **Screenshots:** Professional, high-resolution mockups of the StradaScope Dashboard. These should be clean and highlight key features like the interactive map, trend analysis charts, and prioritized maintenance lists.
*   **Real-World Imagery:**
    *   High-quality photos of road defects (potholes, cracks).
    *   Before-and-after shots of repaired roads.
    *   Images of data collection sources: a discreet smartphone in a car, a satellite, a drone in flight.
*   **Illustrations/Graphics:** Abstract graphics representing data fusion, AI processing, and network connections.
